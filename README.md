# USC-Football-Data-Viz
As a fan of USC Football, I conducted my own analysis using Pandas and Plotly 
in Python to compare the statistics of USC’s defenses over the past 20 years. 
In particular, I was interested in comparing the defensive statistics under head coach 
Pete Carroll and USC Football’s glory days, to their statistics under each coach 
that has followed Carroll.

# USC Football EDA and Data Visualization
As a fan of USC Football, I conducted my own analysis using Pandas and Plotly 
in Python to compare the statistics of USC’s defenses over the past 20 years. 
In particular, I was interested in comparing the defensive statistics under head coach 
Pete Carroll and USC Football’s glory days, to their statistics under each coach 
that has followed Carroll.

The goal of this data visualization project was to compare the statistics of USC Football’s Defense under Pete Carroll (starting in 2002 since that is the year that is considered the start of the dynastic era under him) to the defense under every head coach that coached at least a full season since Carroll left the program. Though the program has never reached the heights that it did under Carroll, there have been many seasons where the team’s offense has been great, putting up a lot of points and even producing a Heisman Trophy Winner. The saying “defense wins championships” is often mentioned in sports, and for the most part is true. This analysis will look further into that and show the stark differences in defensive performance at the program under Carroll compared to the coaches that have led the program since his departure.

*Please note this analysis only includes up until the 2023 regular season*
